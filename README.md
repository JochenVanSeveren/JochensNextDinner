# JochensNextDinner

This is a school project where I learn to use the MVVM architecture pattern and Jetpack Compose.

To run this project, you need to have these listed in your `secrets.properties` file in the root directory:

```properties
API_KEY=
BASE_URL=
AUTHOR_ID=
CLOUDINARY_BASE_URL=
```

Dokka documentation can be found [here](https://jochenvanseveren.github.io/JochensNextDinner/).
